## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Select from “Easy” to “Ultimate Badass”.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Feel accomplished! Or mildly defeated. Either way, every correct word boosts your score—just don’t get too attached.
- **Debug Mode**: For those who appreciate a “training wheels” option. Turn on debug mode to ignore game-over, because rules?
- **Smart Word Placement**: Because we’re kind like that, words appear randomly without overlap.
