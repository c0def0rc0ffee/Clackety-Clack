#  Clackety Clack

**Clackety Clack** — The game that makes you question if your fingers are truly nimble or if you're just hitting keys hoping for the best. Test your typing speed, your keyboard switches, and your patience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Select from “Easy” to “Ultimate Badass”.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Feel accomplished! Or mildly defeated. Either way, every correct word boosts your score—just don’t get too attached.
- **Debug Mode**: For those who appreciate a “training wheels” option. Turn on debug mode to ignore game-over, because rules?
- **Smart Word Placement**: Because we’re kind like that, words appear randomly without overlap.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Difficulty Level**:
   - Use the buttons on the main page to select a level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Ultimate Badass.

2. **Start Typing**:
   - As words fall, type them to score points. Be quick, though—if words hit the bottom (unless in debug mode), it’s game over!

3. **Game Controls**:
   - Simply type the words as they fall. Keep an eye on the level and the score as you play.
